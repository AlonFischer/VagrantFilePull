1. TEST: When xv6 is restarted with the same fs.img, it outputs a "ilock: no type" panic. This is happening because from when we try to redirect the echo hi into a file 'a', it panics due to the now broken logging code, and therefore never actually inserts anything into the file a. This means that when we try to cat the contents of it back out, since there is nothing actually inside of this file, it will panic. This means that the file creation modifications that were written to disk are that a file a was actually created, but there were no modifications written to disk to actually insert anything into this file.
2. FIXING LOGGING: There is no crash this time becuase the recover_from_log function will notice that the file 'a' is empty/broken, and will fix it by re-writing the files head, making it a readable file. However, this file is still empty, because when it was created with 'echo hi > a', which didn't work, it never put anything into the file, so when the recover function attepts to re-insert what the file used to have back inside, there was nothing to re-insert, leaving us with an empty 'a' file.
3. IMPROVING COMMIT: If the block 33 is evicted from the buffer cache before the commit, then when install_trans is called, then the function wont have access to the information stored in the block, and therefore cannot actually begin the information flow from the cache (which was just evicted) to the disk. Furthermore, it wouldn't be able to find or to store that block's values.
